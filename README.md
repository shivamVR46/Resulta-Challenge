# Resulta-Challenge

# Assumptions and Declarations: 

# 1> The URLs will always provide correct data.
# 2> To make it dynamic, the user can give its own refresh rate. (Here 1 minute refresh rate is provided after which the API gets triggered again displaying updated results).
# 3> The response it at last displayed in the JSON format as needed.
# 4> The Date range is hard coded for now which can be also user specific.
# 5> Push model architecture is used where the model will update the user with updated result after every 60 seconds.
